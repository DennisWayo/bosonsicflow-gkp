## Mapping BosonicFlow to PennyLane

BosonicFlow is designed to align with PennyLane’s abstraction philosophy.

- PennyLane exposes logical circuits and operations
- Hardware details are abstracted through devices
- BosonicFlow lives at the same conceptual layer

This project does not introduce new primitives or devices.
It aims to improve conceptual clarity around photonic architectures.
