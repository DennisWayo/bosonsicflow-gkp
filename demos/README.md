## GKP-Based Quantum Error Correction in Photonic Systems

Quantum photonics is a promising platform for quantum computing: photons are robust, fast, and naturally suited for communication. At the same time, photonic systems come with a distinctive challenge — the fundamental degrees of freedom are continuous, while most quantum algorithms are written in terms of discrete qubits.
